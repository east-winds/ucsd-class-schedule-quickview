# UCSD Class Schedule Quickview

The [UCSD Schedule of Classes](https://act.ucsd.edu/scheduleOfClasses/scheduleOfClassesStudent.htm) is somewhat difficult to navigate. This repo allows you to quickly view UCSD course offered in current and previous X years by professor or course name.

Example usage (only tested for bash terminal):

```
./quickview_coursename.sh "GPPS 428"

./quickview_prof.sh "Davidson, Michael"

# Get last four years plus current year of results:
./quickview_prof.sh "Davidson, Michael" 4  
```
