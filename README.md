# UCSD Class Schedule Quickview

The [UCSD Schedule of Classes](https://act.ucsd.edu/scheduleOfClasses/scheduleOfClassesStudent.htm) is somewhat difficult to navigate. This repo allows you to quickly view UCSD course offered in previous 10+ terms by professor or course name.

Example usage (only tested for bash terminal):

```
./quickview_coursename.sh "GPPS 428"

./quickview_prof.sh "Davidson, Michael"
```
